chore(config.h): update FONT2 to use "Noto Color Emoji" font and enable PYWAL
feat(config.h): update keybindings for dmenu_xkb and dmenucmd
The FONT2 variable in the config.h file has been updated to use the "Noto Color Emoji" font, allowing for proper rendering of color emojis. Additionally, the PYWAL variable has been set to 1, enabling support for pywal color schemes.

The keybindings for dmenu_xkb and dmenucmd have been updated. The XK_k key now launches dmenu_xkb, while the XK_c key now launches dmenucmd. This change provides a more intuitive and consistent keybinding scheme.
